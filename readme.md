Collection of JavaScript
========================

This is a collection of small Node modules written in JavaScript. All scripts are designed to be ran in Node.js and can be tested with `npm test`.

Before running the tests you must run `npm install`.

To use each you must `require` them, here is the list:

`arr = require('./arr')`  
`em = require('./easymath')`  
`factorial = require('./factorial')`

More details will be provided soon.
